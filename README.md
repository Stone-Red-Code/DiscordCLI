# DiscordCLI
> Use Discord in the terminal

## Warning
Use this software at your own risk.\
This isn't directly a selfbot, but Discord may count it as User account automation and this is against the terms of use.\
I guess everything should be fine as long as you don't behave conspicuously but still proceed with caution!\
Currently there are no known cases where a user got banned for using this software.\
I will update the above if anything changes!
