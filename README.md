# DiscordCLI
> Use Discord in the terminal

## Warning
**Use this software at your own risk!**\
This isn't directly a selfbot, but Discord may count it as User account automation and this is against their TOS.\
I guess everything should be fine as long as you don't behave conspicuously but still proceed with caution!\
Currently there are no known cases where a user got banned for using this Discord client but that doesn't mean it will never happen.\
Don't blame me if you get banned!\
I will update the above if anything changes!
