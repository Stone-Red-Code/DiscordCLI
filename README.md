# DiscordCLI

> Use Discord in the terminal

## Warning

**If you want to use this software with a user topken use it at your own risk!**\
This isn't directly a selfbot, but Discord may count it as User account automation and this is against their TOS.\

Don't blame me if you get banned!\

You can use this client with a Bot token wihtout breaking Discords TOS
